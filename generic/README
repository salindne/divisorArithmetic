This folder consists of Magma files related to testing our algorithms and 
performing timing experiments for paper submission for CASC2020. These 
scripts can be run using most versions of Magma as only polynomial arithmetic
over finite fields is used.

There are 10 timing scripts that produced the data used in Section 5 of the 
paper submission. These scripts can be run with the following command:

"magma timings_[xx]bit.mag"

where [xx] is the field size in bits being timed.

The file "reduced_basis_arithmetic.mag" provides all algorithms used in our 
experiments and some supporting methods.

The main algorithms are :   Ramified Cantor Add as Add_RAM
                            Ramified Cantor Double as Double_RAM
                            Ramified NUCOMP as Nucomp_RAM
                            Ramified NUDUPL as Nuduple_RAM
                            Negative Reduced Cantor Add as Add_SPLIT_NEG
                            Negative Reduced Cantor Double as Double_SPLIT_NEG
                            Negative Reduced NUCOMP as Nucomp_SPLIT_NEG
                            Negative Reduced NUDUPL as Nuduple_SPLIT_NEG
                            Positive Reduced Cantor Add as Add_SPLIT_POS
                            Positive Reduced Cantor Double as Double_SPLIT_POS
                            Positive Reduced NUCOMP as Nucomp_SPLIT_POS
                            Positive Reduced NUDUPL as Nudple_SPLIT_POS.

The file "reduced_basis_utilities.mag" includes timing methods for fibonacci and 
double chain computations used in the timing scripts.

The file "reduced_basis_tester.mag" compares results of fibonacci and double 
chain methods between Cantor and Nucomp algorithms to check for correctness.

Graphs for all timing experiments are included in the "graphs" folder and the raw
data used to generate the graphs is located in "raw" folder.
